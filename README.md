## 🧪 About the Project

This project demonstrates how to use **Linear Regression** for forecasting temperature using historical weather data. Features include humidity, wind speed, cloud cover, atmospheric pressure, and rainfall. It includes:

* Preprocessing weather data
* Model training and evaluation
* Predicting temperature using user input
* Visualization of actual vs predicted temperatures

---

## 🚀 Features

* ✅ Reads and processes weather data from CSV
* ⚖️ Trains a Linear Regression model
* 📊 Evaluates performance using MSE and R² score
* 📈 Plots actual vs. predicted temperature comparison
* ⏺ Allows users to input values for real-time predictions

---

## ⚖️ Tech Stack

* Python 3.11 or older
* pandas
* scikit-learn
* matplotlib
